      <p>
        The creation of Sudoku is usually credited to Howard Garns of Indiana. The early games were published
        in several puzzle magazines in the 70s and 80s. It was not until later that it became a worldwide phenomenon.

        When the game was introduced to Japan it soon became very popular. It was picked up by newspapers in
        the United States starting in 2004 and soon many books were published along with online versions.
